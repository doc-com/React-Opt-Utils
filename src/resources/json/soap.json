Some organisations extend the value set further with inclusion of additional values such as \u0027Trivial\u0027 and \u0027Very severe\u0027, and/or \u0027Mild-Moderate\u0027 and \u0027Moderate-Severe\u0027, adds to the definitional difficulty and may also worsen inter-recorder reliability issues. Use of \u0027Life-threatening\u0027 and \u0027Fatal\u0027 is also often considered as part of this value set, although from a pure point of view it may actually reflect an outcome rather than a severity. In view of the above, keeping to a well-defined but smaller list is preferred and so the mild/moderate/severe value set is offered, however the choice of other text allows for other value sets to be included at this data element in a template.

Use of \u0027Life-threatening\u0027 and \u0027Fatal\u0027 is also often considered as part of this value set, although from a pure point of view it may actually reflect an outcome rather than a severity. In view of the above, keeping to a well-defined but smaller list is preferred and so the mild/moderate/severe value set is offered, however the choice of other text allows for other value sets to be included at this data element in a template.

Some organisations extend the value set further with inclusion of additional values such as \u0027Trivial\u0027 and \u0027Very severe\u0027, and/or \u0027Mild-Moderate\u0027 and \u0027Moderate-Severe\u0027, adds to the definitional difficulty and may also worsen inter-recorder reliability issues. Use of \u0027Life-threatening\u0027 and \u0027Fatal\u0027 is also often considered as part of this value set, although from a pure point of view it may actually reflect an outcome rather than a severity. In view of the above, keeping to a well-defined but smaller list is preferred and so the mild/moderate/severe value set is offered, however the choice of other text allows for other value sets to be included at this data element in a template.

Use of \u0027Life-threatening\u0027 and \u0027Fatal\u0027 is also often considered as part of this value set, although from a pure point of view it may actually reflect an outcome rather than a severity. In view of the above, keeping to a well-defined but smaller list is preferred and so the mild/moderate/severe value set is offered, however the choice of other text allows for other value sets to be included at this data element in a template.

Some organisations extend the value set further with inclusion of additional values such as \u0027Trivial\u0027 and \u0027Very severe\u0027, and/or \u0027Mild-Moderate\u0027 and \u0027Moderate-Severe\u0027, adds to the definitional difficulty and may also worsen inter-recorder reliability issues. Use of \u0027Life-threatening\u0027 and \u0027Fatal\u0027 is also often considered as part of this value set, although from a pure point of view it may actually reflect an outcome rather than a severity. In view of the above, keeping to a well-defined but smaller list is preferred and so the mild/moderate/severe value set is offered, however the choice of other text allows for other value sets to be included at this data element in a template.

Use of \u0027Life-threatening\u0027 and \u0027Fatal\u0027 is also often considered as part of this value set, although from a pure point of view it may actually reflect an outcome rather than a severity. In view of the above, keeping to a well-defined but smaller list is preferred and so the mild/moderate/severe value set is offered, however the choice of other text allows for other value sets to be included at this data element in a template.

Use of \u0027Life-threatening\u0027 and \u0027Fatal\u0027 is also often considered as part of this value set, although from a pure point of view it may actually reflect an outcome rather than a severity. In view of the above, keeping to a well-defined but smaller list is preferred and so the mild/moderate/severe value set is offered, however the choice of other text allows for other value sets to be included at this data element in a template.

Use of \u0027Life-threatening\u0027 and \u0027Fatal\u0027 is also often considered as part of this value set, although from a pure point of view it may actually reflect an outcome rather than a severity. In view of the above, keeping to a well-defined but smaller list is preferred and so the mild/moderate/severe value set is offered, however the choice of other text allows for other value sets to be included at this data element in a template.
